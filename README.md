## 📌 Overview

The project idea is to develop an analytical system for forecasting the prices of specific metals traded on the Russian financial market.  
The project will incorporate study of modern approaches of precious metal price forecasting and trends to propose a set of instruments suitable for market analysis of specific metal types.  
Additionally, the system will generate reports explaining price fluctuations and potential market volatility based on news, sanctions, macroeconomic indicators, and other external factors.
