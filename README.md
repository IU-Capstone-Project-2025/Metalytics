## 📌 Overview

The project idea is to develop an analytical system for forecasting the prices of specific metals traded on the MOEX or the Tinkoff Exchange.  
The focus will be on 2–3 metals and basic price prediction.  
Additionally, the system will generate reports explaining price fluctuations and potential market volatility based on news, sanctions, macroeconomic indicators, and other external factors.
